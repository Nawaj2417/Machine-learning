    "Ans: We can reduce overfitting on the following ways:\n",
    "      1.Regularization: This technique adds a penalty term to the loss function, which encourages the model to learn simpler\n",

    "    2. Cross-validation: By dividing the data into training and validation sets, we can train the model on the training set \n",
