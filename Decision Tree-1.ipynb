In this scenario, the goal is to correctly identify as many spam emails as possible while minimizing the number of legitimate emails that are incorrectly classified as spam1.\n",

    "In this case, precision is more important than recall because incorrectly classifying a legitimate email as spam (a false positive) can have more serious consequences than failing to identify a spam email (a false negative)1. For example, if an important email from a client or colleague is incorrectly classified as spam, it could result in missed opportunities or lost business. On the other hand, if a few spam emails make it through the filter, it may be annoying, but it is unlikely to have serious consequences.\n",
